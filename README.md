# Ml-Models-From-Scratch

This repo contains all my implementation of the models. 

Just wanted to implement my own models to see how they work internally, I have also compared by models with sklearns models. The models will be devided into two groups 
Supersived and unsupervised.              

Supervised Model Implemented 

Tree based methods 
1. Decision Tree for Classification (supports both 'gini' and 'entropy')
2. Decision Tree for Regression 
3. Random Forest 
4. Gradient Boosting Trees 
5. Adaboost Classifier 


Linear Models
1. Logistic Regression (also includes OVR implementation)
2. Linear Regression 

Neighbours 
1. KNN

Probablistic Methods:
1. Naive Bayes (gaussian kernel)
more will be added 

Dimensionality Reduction 
1. Lda
